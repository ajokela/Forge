Create a set using a hash map.
A set has the qualities of:
	unique elements
	no order
Can use hash map (order function) to give the set an order.

A set of nodes or edges
	add
	addSet
	remove
	removeSet
	clear -- clear the whole set
	*contains* --main case for using a hash map
	size(field)
	data(field)
	items -> returns all items in the set as an array

Need a method that will find all neighbors of function.
